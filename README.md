# ProseBot

ProseBot is a webcrawler targetted at collecting publicly available contemporary fiction from websites. These stories will be used for research in exploring relevant statistical analysis that can help provide insight on measuring reader preference.

Indexed stories will also be used to create a search index allowing people to search for short fiction.

All copyrights will be respected. None of the stories will be republished. However, statistics and metadata will be made available insofar as doing so still complies with copyrights.

# Initial Work

This work is an reboot of an experiment done in 2015, the results of which can be found at my [Bookworm Blog](http://bookworm.davidlday.com).
